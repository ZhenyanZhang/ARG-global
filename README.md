# ARG-global
Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have accelerated microbial threats to human health during the last decade. Here we determined the risk of ARGs from multiple perspectives by using these codes.

These codes including the global mapping of ARGs distribution, regression analysis and machine learning (RandomForest). The scripts of other bioinformatic analysis in standard softwares, including RGI (v5.1.1), BWA (v0.7.13), Samtools (v1.3.1), Diamond (v0.9.36.137), PlasFlow and VirSorter, were mentioned in the related references.
